This is an experimenta fork of [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86) which adds support for Hyper-V acceleration. Head over to https://github.com/mthiim/accel-v86 for a description as well as the source code for the actual accelerator. :-)

The acceleration code (which integrates to the above-accelerator) is on the HyperVAccel branch.
